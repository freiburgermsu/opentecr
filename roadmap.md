# Roadmap

openTECR (Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions) is a database and a community.

We aim to create a reliable, machine-actionable data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

This database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.

Our community organizes openly using a Google Groups (https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr).

This document collects on-going work, ideas for future work, and invites for contributions. Please shoot an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com to get in touch!
