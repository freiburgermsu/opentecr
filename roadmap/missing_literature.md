# Helping to collect literature

You can help to make openTECR work by sending in primary literature of which we know about, but don't have access to.

If you find any of this literature, please send an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com so we can organize the copyright-compliant way of storing it. Thank you so much in advance!


# Finding out how YOU can help

There are three ways in which you can help:

1. you are entitled to free scans because of your institutional affilication
2. you can are located near a library with the work and can spend time on digitizing it
3. you have access to grants or any other money and can pay inter-library loan fees from it


## Institutional affiliation

... IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology): 74MCK (free digitization for IIT staff, faculty, students)

... MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): 90LIU


## Location

I am based at

... Cambridge, UK: 52ASK

... France: 61PRA (available in: Marseille, Montpellier, Paris, Poitiers)

... IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology): 74MCK (free digitization for IIT staff, faculty, students)

... MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): 90LIU

... Oxford, UK: 68VEE


## Access to money

I can easily pay fees for inter-library loans / scans:

* 68VEE (24â‚¬ for scan, pay with IFLA vouchers)
* 74MCK ($45 for scan, pay via credit card)
