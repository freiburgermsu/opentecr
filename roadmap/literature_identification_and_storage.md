# proposals

(Moritz Beber): We could create a shared collection on Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) so that everyone can add relevant papers. Another option is to host a database for JabRef somewhere (https://www.jabref.org/). Both tools are open source but have some restrictions. In Zotero you have to pay for extra space beyond 300 MB which is the only way to add papers to shared collections. In JabRef we need to host the database but there are no other limits. JabRef also allows adding a status, e.g., "to be read", "read", which could be a lightweight way to address your second point.
