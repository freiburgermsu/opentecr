openTECR (Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions) is a database and a community.

We aim to create a reliable, machine-actionable data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

This database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.

Our community organizes openly using a Google Groups (https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr).

This repository contains general information about the openTECR database.

For example, [you can have a look at the roadmap](roadmap.md) of this project.

You can contribute to this and all other repositories in this organization via Pull Requests and/or opening [Issues](https://github.com/opentecr/opentecr/issues). Of course, also feel free to write an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com. See you there! :)
