# opentecr

openTECR (Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions) is a database and a community.

We aim to create a reliable, free, machine-actionable data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with a clear change process to integrate new data and correct errors.

This database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.

## Communication

Our community organizes openly using a Google Groups: visit (https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr).

## Roadmap

[Have a look at the roadmap](roadmap.md) of this project.

## Contribute

If you want to know more about the community, just want to say hi, or share your thoughts, please feel free to write an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com.

If you want to contribute some of your energy to make openTECR work, you can also send an email, have a look at the currently open [Concrete tasks](#concrete-tasks), or come up with new ideas!

You can also use this GitHub repo's [Issues](https://github.com/opentecr/opentecr/issues) function, or send a much welcomed Pull Request to propose specific changes.

## Concrete tasks

* [Check whether there is literature of interest near to you!](./roadmap/missing_literature.md) If so, you can support openTECR by digitizing it.
* Curate recent literature, i.e. extract equilibrium constants, experimental conditions, etc. from provided literature references.
* Give feedback on this README and the other files / information you find about openTECR.

## Get in touch

When in doubt, just send an email opentecr@googlegroups.com -- we are happy to hear from you!
